## Introduction

ChatGPT has recently taken the world by storm. Unless you have been living under a rock, then you have certainly seen a variety of content on this topic. One of its greatest advantages is its ease of use, and it is perfectly usable in Google Apps Script. With that in mind, here is one use case that we can implement: generating fake data.

Fake data is useful for testing purposes. At times, real data is too sensitive, and sometimes you do not have access to real data before production, but you need to begin working with something. Here is where fake data comes in.

We used to have a great library for fake data called [Faker.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker); however, Marak, the author, became so frustrated that he could not monetize the solution that he [pushed an update that broke everything](https://www.thegingerviking.com/the-right-to-delete-fakerjs-fragile-nature-open-source/), which led to him being blocked onGitHub and NPM. As a result, the library is no longer maintained. ChatGPT, however, is not going anywhere.

Take note that ChatGPT is a paid service. However, at this time, you receive a free credit of $18 for three months upon registering, which means that you will be able to follow this tutorial.
